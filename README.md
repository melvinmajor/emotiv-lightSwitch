> Project for the lesson of Signal processing, 3nd Bachelor at EPHEC Louvain-la-Neuve 

*Please note this project is not in good running condition.*

## The Team

Our team is composed of 4 people:

* Melvin Campos Casares (_**@melvinmajor**_)
* Cl√©ment Miesse (_**@cmiesse**_)
* Filipp Shatskiy (_**@fshatskiy**_)
* Hubert Van De Walle (_**@HE201496**_)

## The project

EEG acquisition with EMOTIV helmet, separation of noises (blinking of the eyes) and decision making on the basis of a neuronal rhythm (alpha).
The usage may be linked, for example, to light a led.

### Specifications

We are free to choose the direction we want to take.
There will be no precise specifications ; it's not like the [digital electronics project of 2nd year](https://github.com/melvinmajor/thermopic) where there were clear guidelines.

It is obviously necessary that the quantity and the quality of the provided work are sufficient (example: not just take an existing algo of treatment of images)!
The project can use existing libraries but can not be limited to this (personal contribution has to be made).
It is of course necessary to demonstrate the understanding of the operations of the libraries used.

### Programming language, software/API and material used
